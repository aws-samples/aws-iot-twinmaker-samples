## Use

This package provides sample command line scripts that automate the creation of IoT TwinMaker scenes. Upload 3D assets and place them in a 3D scene connected to IoT data via augmented widgets (tag, motion indicator, etc.).

# Samples:

## 1. COOKIE FACTORY `samples/cookie_factory_sample/`

Use the models in the `scenes` directory for the `--assetDirPath` input.

### Example

If running this script from the root of `aws-iot-twinmaker-samples`:

```
npx ts-node src/libs/scene_utils/samples/cookie_factory_sample/sample.ts --workspaceId [WORKSPACE_ID] --sceneId [SCENE_ID] --assetDirPath src/workspaces/cookiefactory/scenes/
```

### Output

CookieFactory TwinMaker scene with Mixer nodes tied to data, Cookie Line nodes, and a WaterTank with a Motion Indicator widget.

You will need to finish the Getting Started sample [setup](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-twinmaker-samples/blob/main/README.md) for the scene to be connected to data.

## 2. CESIUM `samples/cesium_sample/`

Automates the Cesium Ion pipeline to export directly to TwinMaker.

1. Upload your 3D asset to Cesium and wait for it to perform a tiling optimization.
2. Download the tileset for the asset and upload it to your workspace's S3 bucket.
3. Create/edit a TwinMaker scene with the 3D tileset

### Example

1. Upload a 3D asset to Cesium

```
npx ts-node src/libs/scene_utils/samples/cesium_sample/sample.ts --workspaceId [WORKSPACE_ID] --sceneId [SCENE_ID] --assetFilePath [3D_ASSET_PATH] --cesiumAccessToken [ACCESS_TOKEN]
```

The script will wait up to 5 minutes for Cesium to process the asset's tiles. If it takes more than 5 minutes then run the next command below.

2. Download Cesium tiles and export them into a TwinMaker scene

```
npx ts-node src/cesium_sample/sample.ts --workspaceId [WORKSPACE_ID] --sceneId [SCENE_ID] --cesiumAccessToken [ACCESS_TOKEN] --cesiumAssetId [ASSET_ID]
```

### Output

TwinMaker scene with a node for the Cesium tileset of your 3D asset

### Supported file formats

You can upload any of the following file types to Cesium Ion through the sample script:

- GLTF, GLB, OBJ, FBX, DAE (3D Model), or LAS, LAZ (Point Cloud)

---

## 3. DELETE `src/delete_sample/`

Delete nodes in your scene or the entire scene file.

### Example

1. Delete all nodes in your scene

```
npx ts-node src/delete_sample/sample_delete.ts --workspaceId [WORKSPACE_ID] --sceneId [SCENE_ID]
```

2. Delete the scene in TwinMaker and S3

```
npx ts-node src/delete_sample/sample_delete.ts --workspaceId [WORKSPACE_ID] --sceneId [SCENE_ID] --deleteAll
```
