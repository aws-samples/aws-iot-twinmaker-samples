# Digital Twin AI Assistant

Hi there! I'm an AI Assitant powered by AWS IoT TwinMaker and SiteWise. I can help to conduct root cause analysis,
find information about operational equipment or processes and search relevant documents or data from the digital twin
knowledge base.

To get started, you may try the following questions:

- **Root cause investigation:** what are the potential root causes of inconsistent cookie shapes produced from cookie line?
- **Navigating in 3D:** teleport me to the freezer tunnel
- **Find data related to equipment:** show me all the data of the equipment with id "FREEZER_TUNNEL_e12e0733-f5df-4604-8f10-417f49e6d298"
- **Find standard procedures from knowledge base:** how to defrost the freezer

Also, navigating in 3D has a special function to focus on a particular equipment. After teleporting to a specific equipment,
you can reference the same equipment as 'it' in the following conversations with me.

Please give it a try!
